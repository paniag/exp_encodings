# Rules

Experiments in expressiveness of various styles of representation (primarily
algebraic versus tagless final) in the contexts of interpretation, type
checking, and theorem proving.

A motivation for these exercises is psygnisfive's
[basic-proof-development](https://github.com/psygnisfive/basic-proof-development)
and assertion that tagless final is either useless for type checking or makes
type checking impossible [personal communication].
